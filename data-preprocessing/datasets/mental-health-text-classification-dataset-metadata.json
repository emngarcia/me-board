It is built by combining and preprocessing samples from three public datasets, then creating an **unbalanced main training corpus**, a **strictly balanced test set**, and an additional **feature\u2011engineered sentiment dataset** for analysis and modeling.\n\n***\n\n## Source Datasets\n\nThis dataset is a **derived work** based on the following sources (raw data from these sources is *not* redistributed; only processed, combined samples are included).\n\n### Suicide and Depression Detection (Kaggle)\n\n- **Name:** Suicide and Depression Detection\n- **Author:** Nikhileswar Komati\n- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch\n- **Content:** 232,074 Reddit posts from suicide\u2011related communities, labeled as suicidal vs non\u2011suicidal / depression vs control.\n\n\n### Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health (Kaggle)\n\n- **Name:** Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health\n- **Author:** Suchintika Sarkar\n- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health\n- **Content:** Over 44,000 text statements labeled into multiple mental\u2011health categories such as normal, depression, suicide, anxiety, stress, bipolarity, and personality disorder.\n\n\n### Reddit Mental Health Classification (Murarka et al.)\n\n- **Name:** Reddit Mental Health Classification Dataset\n- **Paper:** Murarka, A., Radhakrishnan, B., \\\u0026 Ravichandran, S. (2021). *Detection and Classification of Mental Illnesses on Social Media using RoBERTa.*\n- **Link:** https://github.com/amurark/mental-health-detection (mirror: https://github.com/amurark/mental-health-classification)\n- **Content:** Reddit posts from mental\u2011health subreddits labeled into ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar, Depression, PTSD, and None.\n\n\u0026gt; **Important:** The raw data from these sources is **not redistributed** here. All provided files are cleaned, transformed, and re\u2011split into derivatives.\n\n***\n\n## Files and Features\n\n### 1. Unbalanced Main Training Set\n\nThe primary training data preserves **real\u2011world class imbalance** after cleaning, label mapping, and deduplication.\n\n- **Total samples:** 49,612\n- **Class distribution:**\n    - Normal: 18,391\n    - Depression: 14,506\n    - Suicidal: 11,212\n    - Anxiety: 5,503\n\nTypical columns:\n\n- \u0060text\u0060 \u2013 Raw or lightly cleaned text.\n- \u0060status\u0060 \u2013 Final label in {Suicidal, Depression, Anxiety, Normal}.\n\nThis is the **recommended split for training**, especially if you want to study models under realistic class skew.\n\n### 2. Balanced Test Set\n\n- **File:** \u0060mental_health_combined_test.csv\u0060\n- **Samples:** 992 (strictly balanced)\n    - 248 samples per class (Suicidal, Depression, Anxiety, Normal).\n\nColumns:\n\n- \u0060text\u0060\n- \u0060status\u0060 (four\u2011class label)\n\nThis file is intended as the **final evaluation set** and should remain unseen during training.\n\n### 3. Feature\u2011Engineered Sentiment Dataset\n\nDerived from the *Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health* source, cleaned and enriched with basic handcrafted features.\n\nCore columns:\n\n- \u0060Unique_ID\u0060 \u2013 Row identifier.\n- \u0060text\u0060 \u2013 Cleaned statement/post text.\n- \u0060status\u0060 \u2013 Normalized label (e.g., Suicidal, Depression, Anxiety, Normal after mapping).\n\nEngineered feature columns:\n\n- \u0060text_length\u0060 \u2013 Total number of characters in the text.\n- \u0060word_count\u0060 \u2013 Number of whitespace\u2011separated tokens.\n- \u0060num_urls\u0060 \u2013 Count of URL patterns (e.g., \u0060http\u0060, \u0060https\u0060, \u0060www\u0060).\n- \u0060num_emojis\u0060 \u2013 Count of emoji characters (basic Unicode emoji detection).\n- \u0060num_special_chars\u0060 \u2013 Count of non\u2011alphanumeric characters (e.g., \u0060@\u0060, \u0060#\u0060, \u0060$\u0060, \u0060%\u0060, \u0060\u0026\u0060).\n- \u0060num_excess_punct\u0060 \u2013 Count of repeated punctuation sequences (e.g., \u0060!!!\u0060, \u0060???\u0060, \u0060...\u0060).\n- \u0060avg_word_length\u0060 \u2013 Average number of characters per word.\n\nThese features support quick classical baselines, feature\u2011importance analysis, and hybrid models that combine deep embeddings with simple text statistics.\n\nIf you also include \u0060mental_health_balanced_train.csv\u0060 (~9,599 rows), describe it as a **downsampled, approximately balanced training subset** created by capping the number of samples per class for convenience experiments, not as the main training distribution.\n\n***\n\n## Preprocessing and Labeling\n\nA unified pipeline was used across sources:\n\n- **Text cleaning:**\n    - Removed rows with missing text or labels.\n    - Dropped duplicate posts based on \u0060text\u0060.\n    - Normalized whitespace and basic formatting via regex.\n    - Filtered out extremely short and extremely long texts to remove non\u2011informative samples.[^1]\n- **Label standardization (4 classes):**\n    - Suicide / suicidal ideation \u2192 \u0060Suicidal\u0060\n    - Depression / depressed \u2192 \u0060Depression\u0060\n    - Anxiety\u2011related labels \u2192 \u0060Anxiety\u0060\n    - Control / non\u2011suicidal / normal \u2192 \u0060Normal\u0060\n    - Other labels (e.g., stress, bipolar, personality disorder, PTSD, unclear) were excluded to maintain a clean four\u2011class space.\n\n***\n\n## Split Strategy\n\nFinal splits are **new** and do not match any original Kaggle or GitHub splits.\n\n- **Training (main):**\n    - 49,612 unbalanced samples with the class counts listed above.\n- **Validation:**\n    - Users should create their own **stratified validation split** from the training file (for example, 10\u201320% hold\u2011out) while keeping the official test set unseen.\n- **Test:**\n    - 992 samples in \u0060mental_health_combined_test.csv\u0060, with 248 examples per class (fully balanced).\n\n***\n\n## Intended Use and Limitations\n\nThe dataset is designed for:\n\n- Mental\u2011health **text classification**, including suicide\u2011risk, depression, and anxiety detection.\n- Studying **class imbalance**, feature engineering, and robustness of NLP models on social\u2011media text.\n- Educational and research use in mental\u2011health NLP; **not** for clinical or crisis decision\u2011making.[^5][^6]\n\nKey limitations:\n\n- **Domain bias:** Mostly Reddit and similar platforms; may not generalize to clinical notes or other apps.\n- **Label noise:** Labels are not clinical diagnoses and may be noisy, sarcastic, or ambiguous.\n- **Limited diagnostic coverage:** Only four final labels (Suicidal, Depression, Anxiety, Normal); other conditions are discarded.\n- **Demographic unknowns:** No reliable demographic metadata, so potential demographic and cultural biases cannot be quantified.\n- **Safety:** Research and educational use only; real\u2011world deployment requires clinicians, extra validation, and safety mechanisms.\n\n***\n\n## Recommended Citation\n\nPlease cite the original sources and this derived dataset, for example:\n\n- Komati, N. *Suicide and Depression Detection* $$\nDataset\n$$.
